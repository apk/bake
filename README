bake is following the tradition of image (of X11 fame), but instead
of using a rather unsuitable preprocessor bake brings its own macro
system, and also implements the basic dependency machine itself.

Or rather, 'will be'.

Simple example:

  Program test
    CSource a
    CSourec b

is expecting source a.c and b.c and links them to a program called
test. And 'bake clean' will delete all generatable files, as the
macros 'Program' and 'CSource' not only generate the compiling
targets and dependencies but also entries for clean. (And you
may get fancy with that.)

  Using mylib
    Program pmy
      ...

will make a program pmy which uses the library mylib. Whence that
comes and what it actually contains is up to some configuration
(which I didn't figure out yet).
